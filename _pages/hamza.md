[Hamza Jawad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamza-jawad-3a4ab5154/) is an MSc researcher whose work focuses on utilizing metabolomics and genomics to combat gastrointestinal parasitic infections in sheep. His research aims to develop a panel of blood biomarkers for the early and precise detection of parasite infections, allowing for individualized treatment strategies that are more effective and less reliant on chemicals. Additionally, he investigates the genetic and genomic factors associated with parasite resistance in sheep.

This dual approach not only enhances the understanding of host-parasite interactions but also promotes sustainable farming by reducing chemical use and minimizing drug resistance. By informing breeding strategies for parasite-resistant sheep, Hamza's work contributes to the long-term health and sustainability of sheep flocks.
