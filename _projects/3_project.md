This project focuses on integrating metabolomics and genomics to identify biomarkers that improve feed efficiency in sheep. By measuring metabolites linked to feed efficiency and identifying genetic biomarkers through genomic signature selection, the project aims to enhance sheep industry practices. The outcomes will lead to increased profit margins, reduced methane emissions per animal, and the development of efficient breeding stock.

### Key Features
- **Metabolomics Analysis**: Measurement of metabolites associated with feed efficiency in sheep.
- **Genomic Signature Selection**: Identification of genetic biomarkers linked to feed efficiency through genomics.
- **Integrated Approach**: Combining metabolomics and genomics for a comprehensive understanding of feed efficiency traits.

### Benefits
- Increased producer profit margins through reduced feed costs.
- Sustainability through decreased methane emissions per animal.
- Genetic selection for breeding more efficient sheep.

### Future Considerations
- Expansion of research to other traits and species.
- Development of commercial applications for the identified biomarkers.
