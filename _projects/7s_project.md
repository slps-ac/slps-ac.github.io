This research leverages machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze the vocal patterns of dairy cows during critical periods such as calving and weaning. The objectives are to differentiate individual cow vocalizations from noise, identify cows based on vocal signatures, predict calving time through vocal changes, and assess post-weaning stress levels by monitoring vocal alterations after calf separation. Continuous audio recordings from 30 cows will be captured using non-invasive collar devices for seven days pre- and post-calving and weaning. Advanced signal processing, feature extraction, and DL models like CNNs and transformers will be employed. The results aim to enhance precision livestock farming by improving animal welfare, optimizing calving and weaning management, boosting productivity, and promoting sustainable practices.

#### Keywords
*Dairy cows*, *Vocalizations*, *Machine learning*, *Calving prediction*, *Weaning stress*, *Precision livestock farming*

### Objectives
1. Differentiate animal vocalizations from background noise.
2. Identify individual animals based on unique vocal patterns.
3. Predict calving time by analyzing pre-calving vocal changes.
4. Assess stress levels by evaluating vocal patterns post-weaning.

### Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Continuous audio recordings from 30 cows will be obtained using collar-mounted devices.
- **Signal Processing**: Noise reduction and feature extraction will be performed on the audio data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: CNNs, ViT, and other models will be used to classify vocalizations and predict calving times.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Differences in vocal patterns pre- and post-calving and weaning will be statistically analyzed.
