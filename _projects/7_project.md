This research project focuses on utilizing metabolomics and genomics to tackle gastrointestinal parasitic infections in sheep. The project involves developing a panel of blood biomarkers for early and precise detection of parasite infections, allowing for individualized treatment strategies. Additionally, it explores genetic and genomic factors associated with parasite resistance. This dual approach enhances the understanding of host-parasite interactions and enables early infection detection. The project promotes sustainable farming by reducing chemical use and drug resistance, and it informs breeding strategies for developing parasite-resistant sheep, ultimately improving long-term flock health.

### Key Features
- **Metabolomics & Genomics**: Integration of metabolomics and genomics to identify biomarkers and genetic factors for parasite resistance.
- **Early Detection**: Development of blood biomarkers for the early detection of parasitic infections.
- **Sustainable Farming**: Promotion of sustainable practices by minimizing chemical use and preventing drug resistance.

### Benefits
- Enhanced understanding of host-parasite interactions in sheep.
- Improved early detection and individualized treatment strategies for parasitic infections.
- Contribution to the development of parasite-resistant sheep, promoting long-term flock health and sustainability.

### Future Considerations
- Expansion of the study to include different sheep breeds and environmental conditions.
- Further exploration of genetic markers for broader applications in livestock management.
