Borzouieâ€™s current research utilizes metabolomics to investigate the effects of Atlantic seaweed supplementation on methane emissions, health, and productivity in heifers. By performing metabolomic analyses, the study aims to identify biomarkers and elucidate metabolic pathways influenced by the supplementation. This research seeks to enhance sustainability and animal welfare by improving the understanding of seaweed's impact on livestock metabolism.

### Key Features
- **Metabolomic Analyses**: Advanced techniques to identify biomarkers and metabolic pathways affected by seaweed supplementation.
- **Seaweed Supplementation**: Focus on the impact of Atlantic seaweed on methane emissions and overall health of heifers.
- **Sustainability and Animal Welfare**: Enhancing sustainability practices and improving animal welfare through better understanding of livestock metabolism.

### Benefits
- Identification of key biomarkers for improved livestock management.
- Potential reduction in methane emissions through dietary adjustments.
- Improved health and productivity in livestock, contributing to sustainable farming practices.

### Future Considerations
- Expansion of research to include other types of seaweed and livestock.
- Long-term studies to assess the sustained impact of seaweed supplementation on livestock health and emissions.
