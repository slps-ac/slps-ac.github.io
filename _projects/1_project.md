This project aims to develop a contactless and non-invasive method for individual cattle recognition using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The approach leverages facial and body features to identify cattle accurately, improving efficiency and reducing stress for the animals.

### Key Features
- **Data Collection**: High-quality images and videos of dairy cows, focusing on headshots, full-body frames, and nostril patterns.
- **Animal Detection and Segmentation**: Use of advanced CNN models like Mask R-CNN and HRNet for precise animal segmentation.
- **Keypoints Detection**: Identification of specific anatomical landmarks on the cow's face and body for unique biometric profiling.
- **Algorithm Development**: Implementation of deep learning algorithms, including CNNs and RF, for high accuracy in identification.
- **Real-Time Optimization**: Techniques like model compression and pruning for real-time application in farm management systems.

### Benefits
- Reduced stress and discomfort for cattle.
- Continuous monitoring and accurate tracking of individual animals.
- Enhanced herd management, leading to better productivity and profitability.

### Future Considerations
- Validation of models across different breeds and environments.
- Potential development of portable devices for real-time cattle identification.
