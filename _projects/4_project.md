Modern livestock production faces the dual challenge of meeting increased demand while ensuring sustainability. This project aims to provide tools for producers to enhance the sustainability of livestock production by exploring the relationships between farm management practices, farm economics, and carbon footprint. The project focuses on three main objectives: developing sensors to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the herd level, identifying management practices that influence GHG levels, and exploring the connections between GHG emissions and socio-economic factors.

### Key Features
- **GHG Emission Sensors**: Installation of sensors on 30 dairy farms across NS, NB, and PEI to measure herd-level greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Management Practices Analysis**: Identification of farm management practices associated with varying levels of GHG emissions.
- **Economic and Social Connections**: Exploration of the relationship between GHG emissions and farm economics, as well as social factors.

### Benefits
- Customized reports for producers, linking their management practices with GHG levels.
- Improved decision-making for sustainable livestock practices.
- Benchmark GHG levels for each province to support sustainability efforts.

### Future Considerations
- Expansion of the project to other provinces and livestock types.
- Development of advanced tools for real-time monitoring and management.
