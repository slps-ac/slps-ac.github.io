This research project investigates the inclusion of kelp as a feed additive for lactating dairy cows, focusing on its effects on methane emissions, reproductive health, and production performance. By incorporating varying levels of kelp (0.5%, 1%, and 2% of dry matter intake) into the cows' diets, the study aims to identify the optimal supplementation level that reduces methane emissions while enhancing milk yield, quality, and reproductive outcomes. This project serves as a bridge between laboratory research and practical application, contributing to more sustainable livestock management practices.

### Key Features
- **Kelp Supplementation**: Inclusion of different levels of kelp in the diets of lactating dairy cows to study its impact.
- **Methane Emissions**: Evaluation of the reduction in methane emissions resulting from kelp supplementation.
- **Production and Reproductive Performance**: Assessment of the effects on milk yield, quality, and reproductive health.

### Benefits
- Identification of optimal kelp levels to reduce environmental impact.
- Potential improvements in milk production and cow health.
- Contribution to sustainable dairy farming practices.

### Future Considerations
- Extension of the study to different breeds and production systems.
